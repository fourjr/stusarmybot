# Stu's Army! Discord Bot

This is a private discord bot for a clan family (https://discord.gg/hw9nmV2).

## Hosting this bot

This is highly discouraged so there won't be any instructions but it's pretty self-explanatory.    
The reason for this code to be here is for education :)

**WARNING!**
Since this bot was made to be a private bot, there are hardcoded IDs all over the place (example is the `on_command_error` function in `bot.py` or `cogs/logging.py`).
